### Project Title
**Fake News Prediction using ML**

### Description
Logistic Regression is a regression approach used for predicting only two possible values.

For this project, we will be building a machine learning model to classify whether the news is *Real* or *Fake* through the News data. Our goal is to work through this notebook by collecting data, preprocessing it, splitting it into testing and training datasets, train the model and evaluate the accuracy of our model.

### Files used
We used the following dataset available through the Kaggle to work on this project:

* [Fake News](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news)
